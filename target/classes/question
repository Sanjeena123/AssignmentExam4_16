Customer login module:
( Create proper project structure like entity, service, dao class etc)

Here customer can register in the application using name, mobile, email address and password.
 Customer can be inserted as an object inside DB table.

Create a method which can take username and password as parameter which customer can insert from console and
if the username and password is equal to customer entered email address and password stored inside db then
 show success message otherwise login failure

Creat a method which can accept name and mobile as parameter which values we can pass from console and
it will update the customer name in db. But for fetching customer details we need to pass mobile as unique
identifier for customer object.
